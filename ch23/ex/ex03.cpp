// You are writing an application that records
// the characteristics of stars that come up
// on the horizon in the order in which they rise.
// In astronomy, the size of the star
// - as well as information on their relative rise
// and set sequences - is important.
// If you're sorting this collection of stars
// on the basis of their sizes, would you use
// std::sort or std::stable_sort?

// Use std::stable_sort to preserve the order of elements.
